            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Such is the filthy and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome contagion of ſinne; nay, ſurely, it is ſo ougly, ſo vile, and

For there is no toade ſo loathſome, no Serpent ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, no creature ſo ougly as ſinne is: nay, if a man (if it were poſſible) ſhould make a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the Spiders, Toades, Snakes, Adders, Serpents, Vipers, and all the moſt filthy things in the world, it vvould not be halfe ſo vile and infectious as Sinne is.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:16427:58"/>
               <p>That this may appeare yet more clearely, thinke with thy ſelfe, what is the moſt deteſtable and execrable thing (beſides ſinne) that poſſibly can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Is it not the Diuell? I know thou vvilt and needs muſt ſay ſo. For his very name doth affright men; and vvhen vvee haue named him, vvee thinke that we haue reckoned the worſt, and the moſt loathſome &amp; hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing that can be: yet I tell thee, that euen Sathan himſelfe, that helliſh Fiend, is not ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſo loathſome, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as ſinne is. Maruell not at this, as though it could not ſo be, but conſider throughly of the matter, and thou wilt eaſily perceiue and willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be ſo. For, vvhat is it that makes the Diuell ſo much abhorred both of God, men, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16427:58"/> Angels? Is it not ſinne, and ſinne onely? yes doubtleſſe: it cannot be denyed. For who knowes not (that knowes any thing) that thoſe damned Spirits, euen all the Diuels in hell,<note place="margin">Iude v. 6.</note> were at the firſt, more glorious, excellent, louely, and amiable Creatures, then any mortall man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; yea, that they were like Starres, Angels of light, ſhining and gliſtering with puritie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe, before they vvere ſtained and defiled vvith the loathſome contagion and infection of ſinne and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Sinne onely it was that blemiſhed that goodly beautie: Sinne onely it was that darkened that vvonderfull brightneſſe and that reſplendent glory, vvherein they vvere at the firſt created, and wherein they ſhould for euer haue continued, had they not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16427:59"/> ſinned againſt the Maieſtie of GOD their Creator. Sinne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it vvas that dimmed all their light, and damped all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the beames vvhereof vvould haue dazeled any mortall eye. Sinne onely it vvas that of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of that Royall palace, that heauenly Paradiſe, that celeſtiall Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.4.</note> the Preſence-chamber of the Lord of glory, made them wretched bond-ſlaues, and moſt miſerable captiues, in that deepe dungeon and darke priſon of hell, vvhere they are kept in euerlaſting chaines of darkneſſe vnto that great damnation. Sin onely it vvas that transformed them into damned Spirits, caſt them downe from the brightnes of heauenly glory, into the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of helliſh miſery, and of bright-ſhining Starres, as it were, made them moſt ougly and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16427:59"/> loathſome Diuels. In briefe; Sin, and Sinne onely, it vvas, that made them as loathſome as euer they vvere louely; as ougly as euer they vvere amiable, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorred of God and of all his holy and elect Angels, as euer they were loued of them before. And were they freed from ſinne, they vvould become Angels of light, glorious creatures.</p>
               <p>Now then, if ſinne doth make others, (yea, ſuch glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Diuels once were) ſo vile and loathſome; yea, odious vnto all other creatures: oh then how vile and loathſome a thing is ſin it ſelfe? Surely ſo hydeous a monſter is this monſtrous Monſter, (I know not how to tearme it) of Sinne, that thoſe vvhoſe eyes GOD hath once opened, that they are able right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcerne of the ſame, vvill
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16427:60"/> vnder-goe any torment,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.8.</note> any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, any puniſhment whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, rather then once vvillingly commit the ſame; as wee may ſee in the examples of many holy Martyrs,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.35 36.37.38.</note> and godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who haue endured the loſſe of their goods, lands, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings; yea, and life it ſelfe: and willingly ſuffered all kinde of tortures and torments that their cruell Aduerſaries and bloudy Perſecutors could deuiſe or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, rather then they vvould be brought to that one ſinne of denying the knowne truth or diſſembling their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Notable to this purpoſe is the ſaying of that auncient and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Father, that he would wiſh rather to be torne in pieces with wilde beaſts then willingly and vvittingly to commit any ſinne. And from a more heroicall and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16427:60"/> diuine ſpirit,<note place="margin">Anſelme.</note> was that ſpeech of him, that profeſſed, that if hee ſhould haue the choyſe eyther to burne in hell fire continually, or to ſinne any ſinne willingly, hee vvould rather chooſe thoſe end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe &amp; vnſpeakeable torments, then yeeld conſent to the other: ſo vile and monſtrous did ſinne ſeeme vnto him.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay more? Men would bee much afrayde, if the Deuill ſhould appeare vnto them in ſome ſhape; yea, the very naming of him ſtrikes a deepe impreſſion of feare into many. But could theſe once behold ſin it ſelfe, which makes the deuill ſo odious, if they could view it, as it is indeed, they would be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flaited and affrighted at the very appearance of it, it vvould make their hearts to tremble within them, and their haire to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16427:61"/> ſtand vpright on their heads; they would flie from it more then from the moſt poiſonous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or venimous creature in the vvorld; yea, as much as from the Deuill himſelfe. They would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhake hands with it, as they haue done heretofore, they would neuer keepe company with it, they would neuer be quiet till they were freed from the dominion and ſlauery of it. It would bee euen death vnto them to haue any fellowſhippe therewith, as no doubt it is to the godly man; who, becauſe hee ſeeth he cannot be fully rid of it in this life, therefore is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often to crie out, as one that were ſtabbed at the heart, <hi>Woe is me that I remaine in Meſheth,</hi>

               <p>In a word, the very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, that he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16427:62"/> ſo filthy a fact, and ſo foule an offence, cauſeth his heart and ſoule euen to bleed within him. Neither hinders it any thing at all, which ſome might bring with ſome colour for the gaine-ſaying of this. What, is ſinne ſo vile and loathſome a thing as you make it? How comes it to paſſe then that it ſeemes ſo ſweet, ſo amiable and pleaſant, as it doth vnto the moſt? How commeth it, that it allureth, enticeth, and draweth men vnto it, cauſing them to follow it, to loue, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, ioy and delight in it: yea, to ſerue &amp; obey it with all greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to ſpend all their time, their ſtrength, vvit and vvealth in the ſeruice of it? Can ſinne be ſo vile and deformed a monſter, and yet bee ſought after vvith ſuch great care and diligence, and purſued vvith ſo great delight
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16427:62"/> and cheerefulneſſe, as if it vvere ſome excellent &amp; pretious thing, vvhich might vvell cauſe all to be enamoured with it.</p>
               <p>To anſwere thee in this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the depth of the myſterie of Sathan, here it lies; herein conſiſts the chiefeſt and craftieſt ſlight and pollicie of that wily Serpent, the Deuill, the enemie of mankinde, vvhereby he hath deceiued &amp; deluded many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, to their vtter ouerthrow. For he knowing wel enough that ſin, if it ſhould appeare in his own likenes, would be abhorred of all men, deales very cunningly and deceitfully, like a crafty marchant. He caſteth a goodly gloze vpon it: He painteth, coloureth it, and guilds is ouer with the falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of his deceiueable pollicie, &amp; withal, caſts a miſt before mens eies, making them fondly belieue
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16427:63"/> that its a goodly thing, a very pleaſant, delightſome or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, euen as the counterfeit and craftie Iugler maketh ſimple men beleeue, that an Oiſter-ſhell or a Counter is a faire peece of ſiluer or gold. And thus hauing trucked and trimmed vp, as it vvere, this curſed darling of his, couering it with the falſe ſhape of ſome ſeeming good, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it with the deceiueable cloake of pleaſure, profit, delight, or one goodly outſide or other, he preſents it to the view of the poore ſeduced ſinner, as ſome rare or pretious thing, who thinking that hee hath met with ſome great treaſure, fals preſently in loue with it, and will part with it for no good; and thereupon entertaineth and lodgeth this vile monſter in the ſecreteſt cloſets of his heart and ſoule. Thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16427:63"/> dealeth with men as the Panther or Leopard deales with the beaſts: For that ſpotted and rauenous beaſt (as is reported of him) knowing how the reſt of the beaſts flye from him, by reaſon of his ougly head, vvhich fraies them, hides onely his head, till they comming about him and gazing on his goodly ſpotted hyde, nothing ſuſpecting, or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the danger they are in, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly hee breaketh out and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a prey of them: ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, knowing well how much ſin would ſcare men, if they ſhould ſee that ougly &amp; deformed head of it, hideth that by all means he can, &amp; ſetteth out the fine colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red skin thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the pleaſing delights &amp; the deceitfull profits and preferments of this vaine and tranſitory world;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.

Oh if men could ſee that filthineſſe, and that vile an loathſome deformitie vvhich lieth lurking vnder that vaile vvhich Sathan hath drawne ouer it to deceiue and delude men vvithall; if they could but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that vnder thoſe ſweet and delightſome baits which are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them there are moſt dangerous and deadly hookes, which if they be not very wary, will quickly draw them vnder the deepe waters of euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16427:64"/> if they were ſo wiſe as to remember that in that golden cup of the pleaſures and profits of ſinne there is nothing but moſt ranke poyſon, the venome whereof, vvill euen drinke vp the health, yea, the life of their ſoules; if they could behold that loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome tode, and that ſtinging ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent which lieth ſecretly hidden vnder the greene and pleaſant leaues of worldly and ſinfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; if they could thinke that in thoſe golden apples there is ſuch deadly poyſon as was in the apple which our firſt parents ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of through the deuils ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
               <p>In a word; if the eyes of their minds were opened that they might ſee the myſtery of Sathan in this worke of iniquity, making ſinne which is ſo vile and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable in it ſelfe to ſeeme ſo

In briefe, he ſeeks by all means to draw, and euen to hale men vnto the committing of it. It's his daily and vſuall trade. He neuer ſetteth himſelfe to any other buſines.

Now who would delight in that which the diuel ſo much delighteth in? who would take any pleaſure in that which is ſo pleaſing vnto him?

Hauing ſeene what this vnion betweene Chriſt and the faithfull is, it is next to bee conſidered how it is wrought in them. This vnion therefore and ſpirituall coniunction is wrought by the ſpirit on Chriſts part, and by faith on our part. Theſe are the two bands of it. Firſt, the ſpirit, through the effectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and working thereof, knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them vnto Chriſt. As the nerues or ſinewes being diffuſed from the braine into all the parts and members of the body doe ioyne and vnite them al vnto the head, from whence they receiue life and action: So the Spirit of of Chriſt, proceeding from him who is the head of the Church,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16427:114"/> is diffuſed as it were, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto his whole body, which is the Church,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 27.</note> and vnto euery member of the ſame, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particuler beleeuer; and ſo knitteth and vniteth them vnto Chriſt their head, ſo that they haue communion with him, and receiue from him all ſpirituall grace,<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 1.16</note> life and motion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto their meaſure<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 12.3. 1 Cor. 12.11.

For they may be ſeperated from it, and ſo periſh; but there is no ſeperation, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, no diſ-vnion poſſibly to be made betweene<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8.39</note> Chriſt and any one of his members, much leſſe the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Againe, (for I had rather bee too plentifull then too ſparing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16427:115"/> in the illuſtration of this ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſo heauenly a truth) as all the members of the body are vnited vnto the head, and quickened by one and the ſame ſoule, vvhich animates them, and conuayeth naturall life vnto euery one of them: So all the faithfull, vvhether they be in Heauen aboue, or in Earth below, of the Church militant, or triumphant, are ioyned and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto CHRIST, by one and the ſelfe-ſame Spirit, vvhich comming from the Head CHRIST IESVS, giueth ſpirituall life, quickening and motion vnto them, ſo that the vvhole body being coupled and knit together<note n="e" place="margin">Epheſ. 4.16.</note> by euery ioynt, receiueth increaſe of grace by degrees, and groweth vp daily more and more, till the body of CHRIST, vvhich is

This is the firſt meanes, whereby this vnion is made betweene CHRIST and the faithfull, euen this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bond of the Spirit. And from this efficacie and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit, vniting vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to CHRIST, it is ſaid by the Apoſtle that wee (euen all beleeuers) haue drunke into the ſame<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 13 Epheſ. 4.4.</note> Spirit. And againe, that wee are baptized into one body; that is, wee are made one Body, vvhereof Chriſt is the Head. Now that other bond, by vvhich they are tied and vnited vnto Chriſt, and that on their part, is Faith. For the Spirit of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing begotten a true and liuely faith in vs by the preaching of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16427:116"/> the Word, by meanes of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent grace we are vnited vnto Chriſt. For thereby we lay hold on Chriſt with all his merits and<note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30 2 Cor. 3.18. Phil. 3.21. 1 Ioh. 3.2.

And hence it is that Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our hearts by<note n="i" place="margin">Epheſ. 3.17</note> Faith. Faith is the hand, as it were, whereby vvee receiue Chriſt being offred vnto vs in the Word; by meanes of it Chriſt is made ours, and we his, by an inſeparable vnion. And thus wee haue at large deſcribed that ſpirituall and myſtical vnion vvhich is betweene Chriſt and the faithfull, his members. So neare and ſo ſtrait a vnion, that the holy Ghoſt in Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſometimes (as was ſayd)

And, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: For who is there that doth not take it more to heart when hee is ill dealt with by him that profeſſeth himſelfe to bee his friend (though it be but once, and in one matter) then if hee were oft &amp; many wayes wronged by him, that is his open and profeſſed enemie? Of the one he could looke for no better; of the other he had no cauſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo bad, but better.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16427:140"/> many indignities which could not be well put vp neither: ſo it is betweene God and them that are Chriſtians, at leaſt in ſhew and profeſſion, and euen when they profeſſe loue and friendſhip vnto him, yet ſhew by their workes that they hate him; yea, whiles they ſeeme to be worſhippers of him, yet doe indeed worſhip the Deuill, yeelding themſelues ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable and obedient to him in the things which hee ſuggeſteth vnto them, and caſting away the Lords Commandements behind their backes. Oh their ſinne is a crying and a prouoking ſinne, it maketh the Lords wrath and iealouſie to burne like fire; hee<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 17.30.</note> winketh at the ſinnes of the Heathen, in a ſort, (though with diſlike, not ſparing them, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting iudgement vpon them, according to the number and

But he frowneth vpon theſe, and taketh notice of them with an yrefull countenance, and writes them all vvith greater letters<note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 2.22.</note> in his Booke of Account, that ſo he may call men to a more ſeuere reckoning for them, and in the fierceneſſe of his wrath, and fury of his indignation, poure out greater vengeance vpon them, becauſe he hath beene more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonoured by them.
